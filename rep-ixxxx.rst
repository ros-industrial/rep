Abstract
========

This REP describes extensions to the ROS-Industrial Simple Message
protocol for controlling the generic IO functionality present on
industrial robot controllers. It specifies additional message
structures used for directly reading and writing IO elements, as
well as for setting up state streaming. Finally, it discusses
alternatives to the proposed structures and provides arguments
for why they were rejected.


Motivation
==========

In order to meaningfully integrate an industrial controller into a
ROS application, two main functional areas of those controllers need
to be accessible: motion control and input-output. Since its
inception, ROS-Industrial has provided an interface to the motion
control functionality through the Simple Message [#simple_message]_
protocol. Although robot specific interfaces were created
[#mtconnect_ros_fanuc_gripper]_ [#clopema_io]_, ROS-Industrial drivers
have been lacking generic, reusable access to the IO facilities
provided by controllers [#issue27]_.

A key principle in the design of such an interface would have to be
the reusability of the client components. Simple Message made this
possible for motion by standardising the protocol used for
communication between the client and the servers. Driver authors need
only implement support for this protocol to be able to reuse the ROS
nodes made available in the *industrial_robot_client* package
[#robot_client]_.

This REP seeks to extend the defined set of Simple Message structures
with new messages and interaction patterns in order to create such a
reusable interface, similar to what exists for controlling motion on
supported industrial controllers.


Definitions
===========

Controller
    The device which provides access to the Robot IO interfaces.
    Typically the same as the one that controls manipulator motion
    and / or network connectivity.
Server
    The part of the ROS-Industrial driver running on the controller
    that provides clients with access to the IO facilities.
Client
    ROS-Industrial node that connects to the server and provides a
    ROS node graph with access to the IO facilities of the controller
    through the implemented ROS API.
Robot IO
    All (electrical) interfaces into and out of the controller that
    an operator can use to interact with and sense the world
    outside that controller. Examples are digital and analogue IO.
    Note that on some controllers the name *Robot IO* is given to a
    specific subset of the available IO facilities. This REP does
    not follow that convention, but instead uses the name to refer
    to all IO Elements on a server.
IO Element
    Smallest, discrete unit of IO that is addressable (whether with
    Indexed or Named IO) for a given IO type. For digital IO, this
    would correspond to a single pin. For analogue IO, this would
    correspond to a single analogue input or output terminal on the
    controller.
Indexed IO
    Type of Robot IO in which IO Elements are accessed by writing to
    or reading from an element in a predefined (global) array or
    other form of indexable structure.
    Typically, the base type of this array corresponds to the type
    of IO: Floating point for analogue IO, Boolean or Integer for
    digital. Numerical indices are used to address specific elements.
Named IO
    Type of Robot IO in which IO elements are accessed by writing to
    or reading from predefined (global) named variables. Only the
    predefined variables can be referenced in program statements,
    with other IOs inaccessible. Typically, the runtime system
    provides the operator with functionality to create, name and map
    variables onto physical IO locations on the controller.


Assumptions
===========

#. In all message structure definitions, *reading* shall be
   understood to transfer data from the server to the client.
   *Writing* is the complementary action, transferring data from the
   client to the server.
#. This REP uses zero-based numbering on all indexable fields. Array
   indices start at 0. Drivers for controllers that use a different
   convention will have to take this into account.
#. Default values for message fields are zero (0) for integer,
   Boolean and floating point fields, and the zero-length string for
   text fields. Unused bits (in bitmasks) should be set to zero (0).
#. All string fields shall use Pascal strings (string length encoded
   as a single byte, followed by character data).
#. No specific byte-order is prescribed in this REP, although driver
   authors are encouraged to use little-endian order for their network
   communications. The ROS generic IO node shall be able to perform
   byte-swapping if needed.
#. Digital IO Elements are assumed to be representable by single-bit
   integer values (ie: Booleans). For Analogue IO Elements floating
   point values are assumed (ie: Floats). Complex IO types will
   require special care during (de)serialisation by both the client
   and the server.
#. None of the message structures in this REP include any fields or
   other substructures for use in message payload validation. A
   reliable transport layer is assumed for all communication between
   client and server. In cases where this cannot be guaranteed, driver
   authors are expected to include sufficient error detection and
   recovery mechanisms at the application layer level, to be able to
   deal with any communication errors.


General Design
==============

This section describes the general design of the Generic IO protocol
extension.


Requirements
------------

Design of the protocol extension described in this REP was guided by
the following high-level requirements:

#. Should try to be efficient in its use of controller resources.
#. Should support reading and writing of the types of IO most commonly
   found on industrial controllers: digital, analogue, grouped.
#. Should try to minimise required user configuration and maintenance
   on the server side.
#. Should make switching between manipulators from different brands
   relatively easy (ie: no recompilation or rewriting of code).
#. Should support extension and specialisation by users.
#. Should not require advanced, dynamic runtime behaviour for its
   basic functionality (ie: be implementable with the constraint
   native languages supported by industrial controllers).

Requirements 1 and 6 imply the use of simple (statically defined)
structures with simple data types. Requirements 3 and 4 suggest the
inclusion of auto-negotiation of features between client and server.
Requirement 5 can be fulfilled by allowing for sufficient unused
message and (sub)type IDs.


Design Overview
---------------

The main purpose of the Simple Message IO protocol extension is to
allow access to the IO facilities of an industrial robot controller.
Similar to the motion interface, this will be facilitated by running
a server component on the controller, and a client component on the
ROS side. The IO server component – implemented in the native language
of the controller – could either be made an extension to an already
running ROS-Industrial server component, or be made to run as a
separate task.
In all cases, the server is responsible for listening for incoming
IO messages, parsing their payload and performing the requested IO
operations. Results are sent back to the client, which will relay
them to the ROS node graph.

The core of this extension is a pair of synchronous read and write
operations, combined with a server side initiated IO state publication
mechanism that is configurable by the client.

This extension does not implement a bi-directional IO memory
synchronisation protocol: the ROS node, while referred to as the
*client* in this REP, initiates all IO operations and controls the
actions of the server. The state of the server's IO Elements is
transferred to the client. Changes to that state are only performed
by the server on the client's request.


Profiles
^^^^^^^^

The IO operations described in this REP have been grouped into
*profiles*: sets of related functionality that servers may implement
support for. Not all profiles are required: a driver can claim generic
IO capabilities when at least the minimum set of operations –
synchronous read and write, the *Basic* profile – has been
implemented. This approach was chosen to ensure that the extension
could be supported on as wide a selection of industrial controllers as
possible, even if some profiles may require interaction with IO
interfaces in ways not all controllers allow (those profiles will then
not be supported by the controller).

Two additional optional profiles are defined in this REP: *Reset* and
*Streaming*. The first makes it possible to reset IO Elements to
their default state (which is controller defined). The second allows
the client to request continuous updates on the state of (a subset of)
the server's IO Elements, without any client side polling. The server
uses asynchronous publications, similar to the joint state reporting
feature of the motion interface in Simple Message.


Feature Discovery
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To avoid the client reporting functionality to the ROS node
graph that servers do not support, and to allow clients to perform
automatic discovery and configuration of supported IO interfaces, the
Basic profile requires servers to include support for a feature
discovery mechanism. Upon request of the client, the server returns
information on the types of IO interfaces it supports, the number of
configured Elements and their directionality (in, out). Apart from
auto-initialisation of the client, this also allows for comparison of
actual against expected manipulator configuration.

As many controllers do not require configured IO indices to be
contiguous, the server reports on groups of Elements, collected into
*ranges*, instead of individual Elements. Each range has an associated
feature descriptor, which encodes whether the server supports a
certain feature or not for that range (ie: analogue Elements may be
resettable, digital may not be). In addition, a global descriptor is
used to report on features that are not range or type specific.


Addressing
^^^^^^^^^^

IO Element addressing is based on ``(type, index)`` tuples, in
which both elements are numerical indices. Servers use a look-up
table to implement the mapping between ``type`` identifiers and the
IO interfaces they represent (`Generic IO Type Identifiers`_). This
table is expected to be small and to be static (as supported IO
interfaces are only expected to change when the (hardware)
configuration of the controller changes). Element indices – within IO
types – are unique, with support for gaps provided by ranging.

Support for named Elements is not part of the protocol extension
described in this REP. See `Default to Named IO`_ in the Alternatives_
section for the rationale behind this design choice. Semantic naming
of IO Elements will be addressed at the ROS API level.


Named IO Controllers
--------------------

The design for servers running on controllers that provide only name
based access to their IO Elements is slightly different.

As these controllers do not allow access to unconfigured (ie:
anonymous and unlinked) IO Elements, a set of named Elements will be
predefined by the driver author, which will then be linked to
controller IOs at configuration time by the user (note 1). The names
of the predefined Elements will reflect their types (fi: ``doutN``,
``ainN``, with ``N`` a positive integer), insofar as this is not
already enforced by the software running on the controller.

A set of look-up tables embedded in the server can now be used to
map between the types and indices specified in the message structures
and the corresponding named IOs on the controller (note 2). For
example, a read request of Element ``5`` of type ``3`` should be
mapped to a read of the named IO ``ain5`` (see
`Generic IO Type Identifiers`_).

Requests by the client for the configuration of the server would
return the hard-coded set of predefined types and indices, based on
the predefined named variables (note 3). This would let the Named IO
controller essentially emulate an Indexed IO controller, albeit with
a (likely) smaller IO space (note 4). It would be the responsibility
of driver users to make sure that all predefined IOs are actually
correctly setup (ie: linked to controller IOs). If possible, driver
authors should strive to make servers capable of dynamically detecting
the number of correctly setup (ie: linked) predefined IOs, and report
only those to the client.
Alternatively, driver authors may provide users with a controller
based configuration interface that allows users to manually provide
this information.

The abstraction provided by this design shields the generic IO client
from the inherent differences between Named and Indexed IO servers.
The remainder of this document therefore will only define interfaces
to Indexed IO servers.


Notes
^^^^^

#. Obviously, the described setup does not require the user to
   configure a *contiguous* range of system IO Elements to be used
   for predefined application IOs, although such a configuration
   would best mimic Indexed IO controllers.
#. Depending on controller support, instead of look-up tables the
   naming scheme could be exploited to dynamically determine the
   mapping between indices and named IO. This would increase
   flexibility of the server, as increasing the number of available
   named IOs would not require updating of the look-up tables.
#. See the ``IO_INFO`` message in the `Basic Profile`_ section.
#. While in theory there is no limit on the number of named IOs that
   could be predefined, practically, the set should be kept rather
   small, as large sets could significantly increase the time spend
   configuring the controller and application.


Message Definitions
===================

The following sections describe the message structures that make up
the Simple Message generic IO protocol extension. The messages have
been grouped into *profiles*, of which only the *Basic* profile is
mandatory. The *Reset* and *Streaming* profiles are optional, however
driver authors are encouraged to add support for at least the
Streaming profile to their drivers.


Overview
--------

The following message structures are defined in this section::

  Basic Profile
    IO_INFO
    IO_READ
    IO_WRITE

  Optional Profiles
    Reset
      IO_RESET

  Streaming
    IO_STREAM_SUB
    IO_STREAM_UNSUB
    IO_STREAM_PUB
    IO_STREAM_CFGGET
    IO_STREAM_CFGSET


ROS-Industrial Packet Header
----------------------------

The following structure describes the *ROS-Industrial packet header*
(copied from [#rosi_rep0001]_)::

  prefix
    length
  header
    msg_type
    comms_type
    reply_code

Whenever subsequent message definitions refer to this header, its
contents (named fields and their types) should be considered to be
part of the definition, and the value of the ``length`` field should
reflect the total number of bytes in the defined message.


Basic Profile
-------------

All generic IO servers shall support the messages defined in this
section. The *Basic Profile* provides a minimal interface to the
IO facilities of a controller, which lets clients perform synchronous
read and write operations (akin to an RPC invocation).

Servers shall use the ``IO_INFO`` message to indicate support for any
additional features they might support.


IO_INFO
^^^^^^^

On reception of this message, servers shall return information on the
types of IO supported, and their configured ranges. Consecutive
Element indices of the same type shall be grouped into ranges, to
limit the size of the reply and to efficiently handle large numbers
of IO Elements.

Range descriptors also indicate support for optional features, such
as change notifications. Feature descriptors have per-IO-type
granularity (ie: a controller may support change notifications for
digital IO, but not for analogue or grouped IO).

This is a read-only message. Controllers that cannot retrieve
information about their IO facilities at run time may opt to hard-code
a minimum support profile into their driver. Alternatively, driver
authors may include a (run time) configuration interface on the
controller which would enable a user to update the information to be
returned, based on the physical configuration of the controller.

Message type: *synchronous service*

Request::

  ROS-I Header
  message_id       : uint32

Reply::

  ROS-I Header
  message_id       : uint32
  ctrlr_feat_mask  : uint32
  num_items        : uint32
  items[]
  {
    type           : uint16
    start          : uint16
    len            : uint16
    feat_mask      : uint32
  }

Defined bit positions in ``ctrlr_feat_mask`` are::

  Pos  Description

    0  Controller Local Timestamps Support

All other positions are reserved for future use.

Defined bit positions in ``feat_mask`` are::

  Pos  Description

    0  IO Reset Support
    1  Streaming Support

All other positions are reserved for future use.

Errors

- None

Notes

#. The ``message_id`` field shall be copied unchanged by servers from
   requests to replies. Clients can use this field to differentiate
   between subsequent messages. Its use is not mandatory. If left
   empty by a client, servers shall also leave the field empty in the
   reply.
#. The ``num_items`` field shall encode the number of repeated
   entries in the ``items`` array. In most cases, this number will
   be different from the byte length of the array, which can be
   calculated as ``num_items * (num fields * sizeof(each field))``.
#. Refer to section `Generic IO Type Identifiers`_ for a list of all
   defined values for the ``type`` field.
#. The ``start`` and ``len`` fields fully define an IO range: the
   ``start`` field denotes the index of the first IO Element in the
   range, the ``len`` field denotes the number of IO Elements in the
   range. A range with a length of 1 addresses a single IO Element.
#. It is an error to return overlapping ranges (ie: ranges for which
   the ``start`` index lies within another range).
#. Element indices must be globally unique within their IO type: no
   two ranges may contain the same ``start`` index, or contain indices
   from other ranges.
#. The ``ctrlr_feat_mask`` and ``feat_mask`` fields are bitmasks. A
   bit with a value of 1 indicates support for a feature. All other
   bit positions are reserved, and should be initialised to zero. Bit
   positions are counted starting from LSB.


IO_READ
^^^^^^^

Requests the controller to read the value of the specified IO
Element(s).

It is allowed for one read request to access multiple different
indices, each reading Elements of a different type (example: two
digital IOs, one analogue).

Message type: *synchronous service*

Request::

  ROS-I Header
  message_id : uint32
  num_items  : uint32
  items[]
  {
    type     : uint16
    index    : uint16
  }

Reply::

  ROS-I Header
  message_id : uint32
  timestamp  : uint32
  num_items  : uint32
  items[]
  {
    type     : uint16
    index    : uint16
    result   : uint16
    value    : uint32
  }

Errors

- IO type not supported (1001)
- Invalid index: out of bounds for IO type (2001)

Notes

#. Refer to section `Status and Error Codes`_ for a list of all
   defined error and status codes.
#. The value of the ``result`` field shall reflect the outcome of the
   requested operation. If not equal to ``SUCCESS``, the *Errors*
   subsection of each message definition lists the possible return
   values. For messages that support batching of operations, the
   result of each individual operation shall be reflected by the
   ``result`` field in the returned array, in addition to the
   ``reply_code`` field in the ROS-I header. Whenever both a per-type
   and a per-Element return value is defined by this REP, the
   per-Element value should be returned.
#. The value of the ``value`` field is undefined in case the
   read operation was unsuccessful (ie: ``result`` is not equal to
   ``SUCCESS``).
#. The actual type (ie: *Integer* or *Float*) of the ``value`` field
   depends on the value of the ``type`` field (see section
   `Generic IO Type Identifiers`_). In all cases, the server shall
   serialise the value of the requested IO Element to the 4 byte
   field, and the client casts to the appropriate type on reception
   of the message.
#. For IO Elements with a representation with a lower number of
   significant bits than the number reserved for the ``value`` field
   in the reply, the server shall align the lowest significant bit
   (LSB) of the IO-value with the LSB of the ``value`` field (for
   example: 12-bit analogue IO values are serialised with their LSBs
   at bit 0 of the ``value`` field).
#. As controller support is expected to be minimal, this REP does
   not set a requirement for batched reads of multiple IO Elements
   to be *instantaneous* or to be executed at exactly the same point
   in time (although driver authors are encouraged to minimise
   delays). Clients that require snapshot behaviour could potentially
   issue read requests to *grouped inputs*.


IO_WRITE
^^^^^^^^

Complementary to the ``IO_READ`` message. On reception of this
message, servers shall set the value of the specified IO Elements to
the provided value.

Writes to multiple Elements may be batched into one message with
multiple elements and send in a single request. Writes to multiple
different types of IO in a single request are also permitted (for
example: two digital IOs, one analogue).

Message type: *synchronous service*

Request::

  ROS-I Header
  message_id : uint32
  num_items  : uint32
  items[]
  {
    type     : uint16
    index    : uint16
    value    : uint32
  }

Reply::

  ROS-I Header
  message_id : uint32
  timestamp  : uint32
  num_items  : uint32
  items[]
  {
    type     : uint16
    index    : uint16
    result   : uint16
  }

Errors

- IO type not supported (1001)
- Invalid index: out of bounds for IO type (2001)
- Invalid value: out of bounds for IO type (2002)

Notes

#. Refer to Note 4 of ``IO_READ`` for how the ``value`` field of the
   request should be handled.
#. Refer to Note 5 of ``IO_READ`` for how smaller types should be
   serialised into the ``value`` field of the request.
#. Note 6 of ``IO_READ`` is also applicable to ``IO_WRITE``.


IO Reset (optional)
-------------------

Servers that support this optional interface allow clients to request
IO Elements be returned to their default state. Such a reset could be
part of an error recovery strategy, or a normal start-up routine.


IO_RESET
^^^^^^^^

Upon reception of this message, servers shall reset the state of the
specified IO Elements to their default values. This default may for
instance be the value Elements have after initial start-up of the
controller, or a value that is configurable by the user on the
controller itself.

Message type: *synchronous service*

Request::

  ROS-I Header
  message_id : uint32
  num_items  : uint32
  items[]
  {
    type     : uint16
    index    : uint16
  }

Reply::

  ROS-I Header
  message_id : uint32
  num_items  : uint32
  items[]
  {
    type     : uint16
    index    : uint16
    result   : uint16
  }

Errors

- IO type not supported (1001)
- Feature not supported by IO type (1002)
- Feature not supported by IO index (1003)
- Invalid index: out of bounds for IO type (2001)

Notes

#. Clients may request a reset of all IO Elements by sending a request
   with a single (1) element, specifying a value of ``0xFFFF`` for
   both the ``type`` and the ``index`` fields.
#. Clients may request a reset of all defined ranges for a specific
   IO type by sending a request with a value of ``0xFFFF`` for the
   ``index`` field, and the ``type`` field set to the value
   corresponding to the IO type (see `Generic IO Type Identifiers`_).


Streaming Interface (optional)
------------------------------

Servers that support this optional interface shall be able to publish
the state of their IO Elements at a certain rate, without the need
for an explicit polling cycle initiated by the client (using
``IO_READ``).

As it is infeasible to publish the state of *all* IO Elements
continuously, a subscription mechanism will be provided, allowing
clients to notify the server of their interest in specific IO Elements,
which will then be included in the publication.


IO_STREAM_SUB
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Request the inclusion of a range of IO Elements in the state
publication report periodically send out by the server.

Clients may subscribe to subsets of Elements within defined ranges, as
described by the ``IO_INFO`` reply message. Multiple subscriptions
may be batched into one request.


Message type: *synchronous service*

Request::

  ROS-I Header
  message_id : uint32
  num_items  : uint32
  items[]
  {
    type     : uint16
    start    : uint16
    len      : uint16
  }

Reply::

  ROS-I Header
  message_id : uint32
  num_items  : uint32
  items[]
  {
    type     : uint16
    start    : uint16
    result   : uint16
  }

Errors

- IO type not supported (1001)
- Feature not supported by IO type (1002)
- Feature not supported by IO index (1003)
- Invalid index: out of bounds for IO type (2001)

Notes

#. A subscription to a range that starts at index 4 and has length 2
   will result in IO Elements 4 and 5 to be added to the
   ``IO_STREAM_PUB`` payload.
#. Clients may subscribe to a range with a ``len`` equal to 1 in order
   to stream individual IO Elements.
#. Servers should fail requests for subscriptions to ranges which
   include IO Elements not contained in any of the defined IO ranges
   (as reported by the ``IO_INFO`` response message). Clients should
   avoid trying to subscribe to IO Elements not contained in any
   valid range by checking against known ranges prior to sending a
   request.


IO_STREAM_UNSUB
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Upon reception of this message, servers shall cancel the
subscriptions for the specified ranges. Any subsequent
``IO_STREAM_PUB`` messages shall not include the state of Elements in
the unsubscribed ranges. Multiple ranges may be unsubscribed in one
request.

Clients shall identify ranges by providing the index of the IO Element
that forms the start of the range, and the IO type for each range.

Message type: *synchronous service*

Request::

  ROS-I Header
  message_id : uint32
  num_items  : uint32
  items[]
  {
    type     : uint16
    start    : uint16
  }

Reply::

  ROS-I Header
  message_id : uint32
  num_items  : uint32
  items[]
  {
    type     : uint16
    start    : uint16
    result   : uint16
  }

Errors

- IO type not supported (1001)
- Invalid index: out of bounds for IO type (2001)
- Invalid index: no known subscription (2003)

Notes

- None


IO_STREAM_PUB
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This message shall be send by the server at a certain rate to publish
the state of all IO Elements in which the client has expressed an
interest. Based on the number of subscriptions, messages may contain
the state of multiple Elements (potentially of different types).

Message type: *asynchronous publication*

Msg::

  ROS-I Header
  timestamp : uint32
  num_items : uint32
  items[]
  {
    type    : uint16
    start   : uint16
    len     : uint16
    values[]
    {
      value : uint32
    }
  }

Errors

- None

Notes

#. The ``timestamp`` field should be set to the value of a local
   (high resolution) clock by servers that support this (see
   ``IO_INFO``). Servers without such support should initialise the
   field to 0.
#. Refer to Note 4 of ``IO_READ`` for how the ``value`` field of the
   request should be handled.
#. Refer to Note 5 of ``IO_READ`` for how smaller types should be
   serialised into the ``value`` field of the request.


IO_STREAM_CFGGET
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Upon reception of this message, servers shall return the value of the
specified item from the current streaming configuration.

Multiple configuration items may be accessed in one message.

Message type: *synchronous service*

Request::

  ROS-I Header
  message_id : uint32
  num_items  : uint16
  items[]
  {
    item     : uint16
  }

Valid IDs for the ``item`` field are::

  ID      Type     Description
       1  Integer  Global publish period (us): determines publication
                   rate used for all ranges.

All other IDs are reserved for future use.

Reply::

  ROS-I Header
  message_id : uint32

Status and Error Codes
----------------------

This section defines status codes and associated error messages::

  ID            Description

             0  Reserved

             1  Success

        2-1000  Reserved for future use

          1001  IO type not supported
          1002  Feature not supported by IO type
          1003  Feature not supported by IO index

     1004-2000  Reserved for future use

          2001  Invalid index: out of bounds for IO type
          2002  Invalid value: out of bounds for IO type
          2003  Invalid index: no known subscription

     2004-3000  Reserved for future use

          3001  Invalid index: no such item
          3002  Invalid value: out of bounds for item

    3003-64000  Reserved for future use

   64001-65000  Manufacturer specific

   65001-65535  Freely assignable

The IDs allocated to the *Manufacturer specific* range may be
used by driver authors to add error messages that are too specialised
to be included in the generic IO client. Note that the generic IO
client will not be able to decode these IDs, and driver authors are
expected to provide an extended version of the client able to decode
messages with manufacturer specific IDs.

All IDs allocated to the *Freely assignable* range may be freely used
by users and allows for ID assignment within a limited scope (ie:
per project).


Generic IO Type Identifiers
---------------------------

This section defines numeric identifiers for IO types, to be used
in the IO ``type`` fields::

  ID            Description

             0  Reserved

             1  Digital In
             2  Digital Out
             3  Analogue In
             4  Analogue Out
             5  Grouped In
             6  Grouped Out
             7  Flags

       8-64000  Reserved for future use

   64001-65000  Manufacturer specific

   65001-65535  Freely assignable

The IDs allocated to the *Manufacturer specific* range may be
used by driver authors to add support for types of IO that are too
specialised to be included in the generic IO client. Note that the
generic IO client will not be able to decode these IDs, and driver
authors are expected to provide an extended version of the client
able to decode messages with manufacturer specific IDs.

All IDs allocated to the *Freely assignable* range may be freely used
by users and allows for ID assignment within a limited scope (ie:
per project). An example would be IO messages for custom end effector
hardware that do not fall into any of the already defined categories.


ROS API
=======

A suitable ROS API will be defined in a separate REP. This API will
define topics and services that can be used to interact with drivers
that have implemented the IO interfaces specified in this REP.


Alternatives
============

This section reasons about alternative design choices and why they
were rejected.

Default to Named IO
-------------------

As the most obvious alternative, Named IO would use strings to address
the IO Elements on the controller. No type or index information would
need to be communicated, as unique strings can unambiguously identify
an IO Element on the server.

The main advantage of this would be the possibility to directly map
IO Element names to topics and services, removing the need for any
look-up tables on client or server. In addition, the names would
provide an abstraction layer between the physical IO point (ie: actual
pin on an IO terminal) and the logical entity used to address it.
Such a layer would facilitate switching between controllers, as IO
references can be rewired by simply changing names and connections.

There are however several significant drawbacks to the use of a name
based addressing scheme – at the Simple Message layer – which lead
to this alternative being rejected.

First, depending on the actual naming scheme, named references can
significantly increase the payload sizes of Simple Message structures.
For example: a read of an IO Element named *GripperClosed* would
require ``13`` bytes (just the identifier, not including other fields).
Using Indexed IO, this read would serialise to ``2 + 2 == 4`` bytes
(for the ``type`` and ``index`` fields). Choosing a naming scheme as
described in the `Named IO controllers`_ subsection of the
`General Design`_, would result in names such as ``din4`` and
``aout10``. While this would reduce serialised message size, it also
negates the main advantage of Named IO: support for semantic naming.

Second, not all industrial controllers support string parsing
operations sufficiently or are able to deserialise strings efficiently
from network traffic. String parsing is also inherently slower than
dealing with integers.

Third, as Indexed IO controllers do not support named references to
IO Elements, driver authors would have to implement a look-up table
and provide a means for users to keep that table up-to-date (although
the same is true for Named IO controllers in the current design).

Fourth, many Named IO controllers impose certain constraints with
respect to naming IO Elements. Maximum length limitations and
restrictions to certain character set are common. The names would
have to be exported to the ROS registry by the client, which could
lead to incompatibilities with established naming guidelines
[#ros_naming_resources]_ [#ros_names]_. Re-using IO Element names from
one controller to another would also be problematic, unless a smallest
common denominator approach is used.

Fifth, many Named IO controllers do not support run-time, string based
addressing of their IOs, but only allow static, compile-time global
variable references to be used (rewiring is typically used in such
cases to allow users to connect names to existing IO Elements on the
controller). This restriction would make it impossible to implement a
server application that dynamically addresses IO Elements based on
message contents without relying on a look-up table again.

Finally, the main advantages of Named IO – semantic naming, rewiring –
can be supported on the ROS API level, either with currently
existing mechanisms in ROS or with new functionality provided by the
client(s).


Named IO with Indexed Protocol
------------------------------

The second alternative considered is a hybrid between Named and
Indexed IO. In this alternative, names are used to address individual
IO Elements, but in order to avoid the increase in message payload
sizes, the client places only numerical IDs and indices in the
serialised payloads (such as those defined in
`Generic IO Type Identifiers`_). The mapping between names and indices
would be done via a look-up table on the client side, using
``name → (type, index)`` pairs. Names recognised by the client are
those configured on the server.

While this approach would allow all of the benefits described in the
first alternative, without the associated increase in message sizes,
the use of an additional look-up table would increase maintenance
effort for users, as they have to keep this table up-to-date, as well
as the table in use on the server. In addition, it only deals with the
increase in payload size, and does not address any of the other
issues.


Single 'IO Operation' Message Structure
---------------------------------------

Instead of separate messages for synchronous read and write, a single
message structure is defined, in which every element of the
``items[]`` array has one additional field:  ``sub_cmd``. The
value of this field determines whether a read or a write is performed.
A single message payload may combine multiple reads and writes. This
alternative could be used with both Indexed and Named IO.

This alternative was rejected due to the fact that combining all IO
operations into one message, and relying on sub IDs to discriminate
between operations is not substantially different from using
individual message types (with support for batched operations). It is
therefore not expected to provide any significant benefits over the
design described in `General Design`_. Message parsing would however
be slightly complicated by the differences between read and write
operations and message sequences would become less explicit as intent
is encoded by a (sub)field only.

Additionally, it is unclear whether the temporal distribution of reads
and writes will ever allow for them to be combined into one message
(without resorting to buffering on the client), leading to multiple
messages being used and negating any potential decrease in network
traffic.

Finally, a combination of synchronous writes and IO streaming would
seem to cover the same use cases.


Backwards Compatibility
=======================

This REP extends the simple message protocol with new message types.
No changes are proposed to existing message structures, or to their
semantics.

With respect to backwards compatibility, both clients and servers
need to be considered.

Servers
-------
Servers that have not yet implemented the generic IO interface should
not be affected, provided that they have proper mechanisms in place
for dealing with unknown message types. The messages defined in this
REP should result in an error being returned, with no further action
by the server.

Clients
-------
Clients that have not implemented the IO interface should not receive
any IO related messages, as the server should not send any without
having been instructed to do so by the client. The generic industrial
robot client [#robot_client]_ currently prints an error on reception
of unknown message types, and this should be sufficient to deal with
any spurious IO messages from servers.


Reference Implementation
========================

A reference implementation of a generic IO client will be made
available in the ``industrial_core`` package. IO servers for each of
the supported controller types will need to be implemented by
maintainers of the respective drivers.


Impact on Other Tools
=====================

The Wireshark Simple Message dissector plugin [#wshark_dissector]_
will be updated to add support for the new messages defined in this
REP.
